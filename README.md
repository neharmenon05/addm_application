# ADMM and Lasso Regression 

The project explores the mathematical formulations and real-life applications of Lasso regression 
and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Lasso regression is an effective 
technique in handling high dimensional data by imposing regularization. Similarly, ADMM is a 
powerful optimization tool that supports distributed and constrained optimization tasks. 
Leveraging the potential of these concepts we can implement a range of applications in python 
like feature selection and reconstructing audio signal, comparing Lasso with linear regression 
models on datasets related to salary and diabetes, predicting house prices, and exploring cement 
strength predictions using ADMM-distributed Lasso. Each application demonstrates adaptability 
across domains, emphasizing its value in achieving accurate results. This project provides details 
regarding implementation and impact of these techniques in diverse fields, contributing to a 
deeper understanding of their importance.
